1.What is a VNET and what is it used for in Azure?
The Microsoft Azure Virtual Network service enables Azure resources to securely communicate with other in a virtual network. A virtual network is a representation of your own network in the cloud. A virtual network is a logical isolation of the Azure cloud dedicated to your subscription. 

2.The fully managed service in Azure that is used for cross-premises connectivity, is called what?
Virtual Network Gateway.

3.List three things you need to know when setting up a virtual network.
Address space, subnets and DNS server that is being used.

4.What is the primary purpose of establishing a subnet?
Overall network traffic is reduced and network performance is improved.

5.When in the deployment process of multiple Virtual Machines(VMs) are the VMs assigned their IP address?
The VMs are assigned IP addresses as they are booted up.

6.Why should you set the location of the Resource Group?

7.What are the four rules to editing a template to redeploy?
Resources that are unchanged but are still in the template are ignored.

8.Why should you not request a complete deployment using powershell?
This might lead to losing a section of the template without being able to recover it.

9.Why did Microsoft create NSGs?
Network Security Group (NSG) is the main tool you need to use to enforce and control network traffic rules at the networking level. Customers can control access by permitting or denying communication between the workloads within a virtual network, from systems on customer’s networks via cross-premises connectivity, or direct Internet communication.

10.What is VPN according to the book?
A Virtual Private Network (VPN) allows a company to deploy connectivity to multiple users over a public shared infrastructure (the Internet or an Internet Service Provider's network) enforcing its own policies (such as security, quality of service, private addressing) as if it was its own private network.
